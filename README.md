# UNIX Primer for developers

A primer on how to learn how to use unix. Aimed at a computer-literate audience.

The idea was formed by seeing 3rd year computer science students
stuggling to use UNIX for their assignments. The assignments were
required to be done using, or handed in using UNIX.

The concept of the book is to be pocket sized, like O'Reilly pocket
books. A quick reference with a command very quickly discussed,
a short discussion and an example.

Couldn't these people just go to stack overflow? Well... no...
this book, at minimum can get computer literate people the right questions
to ask.

Goals for readers, in order:

1. Give users the right questions to ask
2. Give users information about some simple commands
3. Give users a base knowledge of how a UNIX system works

A side goal of the book is that it could be used as a text book in a 3-5
hour seminar about how to get started with UNIX.

## Project structure

There's 3 files at the top level, set up in a kinda unix-y way. 

- **notes**: Notes about where we're looking for the project to go
- **obj**: folder where generated files go
- **src**: folder where source files for the project go

Within the src folder, there is a folder for each chapter of the book.
